        "- Creates a dedicated warehouse to track agent costs\n",
        "- Creates 3 optimized views for cost analysis\n",
        "- Generates a semantic model for natural language queries\n",
        "- Provides instructions to create the Cortex Analyst agent\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "- \u2705 **Flexible time periods** - Ask about any time range (up to 365 days)\n",
        "- \u2705 **Product categories** - Analyze costs by AI, Storage, Compute, etc.\n",
        "- \u2705 **Natural language** - Use plain English to query your data\n",
        "- \u2705 **Cost tracking** - Monitor the agent's own costs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Questions You Can Ask\n",
        "- What is my daily AI cost for the last 30 days?\n",
        "- Show me costs for warehouse X in March 2025\n",
        "- Compare my costs from last week to this week\n",
        "- Show me Q1 2025 costs by product categories\n",
        "- What are my top 5 most expensive warehouses?\n",
        "- How much did I spend on compute vs storage in January?\n",
        "- How much does the cost agent itself cost?"

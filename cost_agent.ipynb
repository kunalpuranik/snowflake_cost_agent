        "## Key Changes in v2.0:\n",
        "- \u2705 **No time restrictions** - Ask about any time period\n",
        "- \u2705 **Simplified views** - Only 3 views (was 5)\n",
        "- \u2705 **Removed DAYS_BACK** - Time periods defined in questions\n",
        "- \u2705 **Cortex handles time filtering** - Views expose all data\n",
        "- \u2705 **Fully automated** - No manual steps\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Questions (Any Time Period!):\n",
        "- What is my daily AI cost for the last 30 days?\n",
        "- Show me costs for warehouse X in March 2025\n",
        "- Compare my costs from last week to this week\n",
        "- Show me Q1 2025 costs by product categories\n",
        "- What are my top 5 warehouses in the last 90 days?\n",
        "- How much did I spend on compute vs storage in January?\n",
        "- Show me cost trends over the past 6 months\n",
